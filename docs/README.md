# Technical Documentation

This directory contains detailed technical documentation for the order book simulator, covering everything from core algorithms to production deployment considerations. These documents dive deep into the implementation details, design decisions, and real-world context behind the system.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into four main areas, each building on the others:

### üìä [Order Book Mechanics](order_book_mechanics.md)
**Core algorithms and data structures**

Covers the fundamental matching engine that powers electronic exchanges. This is where orders become trades through price-time priority algorithms.

- How FIFO matching works in practice
- Data structure choices and their performance implications
- Order lifecycle from submission to execution
- Market data generation (Level 1/2/3 feeds)
- Integration with risk management systems

**Key topics:** Red-black trees, order state machines, cache optimization, complexity analysis

---

### üèóÔ∏è [System Architecture](system_architecture.md)
**Component design and system integration**

Shows how all the pieces fit together to create a complete trading system. Focuses on modularity, performance, and reliability.

- Component interaction and data flow
- API design (REST endpoints, WebSocket feeds)
- Single-threaded vs multi-threaded architectures
- Deployment strategies and scaling approaches
- Fault tolerance and graceful degradation

**Key topics:** Event sourcing, circuit breakers, load balancing, microservices patterns

---

### üöÄ [Performance Engineering](performance_engineering.md)
**Low-latency optimization techniques**

Deep dive into the optimizations that enable sub-millisecond performance. Covers both software and hardware considerations.

- Memory management and object pooling
- CPU optimization (cache efficiency, branch prediction, SIMD)
- Lock-free data structures for concurrency
- Hardware considerations (NUMA, TSC timing)
- Profiling and benchmarking methodologies

**Key topics:** Zero-allocation programming, cache-friendly algorithms, hardware timestamping

---

### üèõÔ∏è [Market Microstructure](market_microstructure.md)
**Financial markets and regulatory context**

Explains how real financial markets work and why certain technical decisions matter. Bridges the gap between implementation and business requirements.

- How modern exchanges operate (NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.)
- Professional order types and execution algorithms
- Market making strategies and liquidity provision
- Regulatory requirements (Reg NMS, MiFID II)
- Risk management and compliance frameworks

**Key topics:** Central limit order books, adverse selection, smart order routing, circuit breakers

## How to Read This Documentation

### If you're interested in the **algorithms and data structures**:
